            <title><![CDATA[I'm a Yogini]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I'm a Yogini</h1><p>I was born in Bolivia but at the age of 9 my parents moved to Belgium.  As a child I loved to dance. Movement was everything for me. Drawn to the magic of storytelling I did my master in Cinematography in RITS and soon after my graduation I started to work as a Television Director. Long hours and lot's of stress where very common on my job but I loved it because I was always working with different people, different places and alwasy telling story's. My love 
for yoga started in 2004. I first started with Bikram Yoga because I 
loved the challenge in the hot studio.And the routine was very handy to empty my head. After some years loving that I 
wanted to become more peacefull and started practicing Hatha Yoga. But 
for me that wasn’t challenging enough so there came the dancer in me again and
 I fell in love with Vinyasa Flow.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b2567541881c6a2ecf449092b6884e438e70265b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
