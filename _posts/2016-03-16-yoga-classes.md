## In my home studio

**1 Discover Yoga**

If you are new to yoga this is it! Just try it... everyone is new so have no shame! Play and let it go.

**2 Tone your Body for Summer Yoga**

This may I want to start this series. Each Saturday morning and Wednesday evening (if there are enough candidates)

Vinyasa Flow Classes with a lot of Yang energy. Get energized and **core-toned** for steamy summer nights! Let's detox first and then get all the sweet sukha (this is the good stuff) back into our lives. You'll love this!

I promise.

Each Class is 75' and starts with Pranayama or Breathing exercises. Followed by warming-up and then we start flowing. At the end there is always Savasana.
