## In my Home Studio

**1 Discover Yoga **

If you are new to yoga this is it! I understand that a big yoga studio can be hard to step into for the first time, that is why I start this sessions. Just try it... it's in my place, everyone is new to yoga: so have no shame!   
Play, loose your fears and let it go. 

From September 2016\. 

**2 Tone your Body with Yoga**

Vinyasa Flow Classes with a lot of Yang energy. Get energized and **core-toned** for steamy nights! Let's detox first and then get all the sweet sukha (this is the good stuff) back into our lives. You'll love this!

I promise.

Each Class is 75' and starts with Pranayama or Breathing exercises. Followed by warming-up and then we start flowing. At the end there is always Savasana.

## On the move...
