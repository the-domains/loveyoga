**2 Tone your Body for Summer Yoga**

Start 09 April 2016 until June. 

Each Saturday morning and Wednesday evening

This are Vinyasa Flow Classes with a lot
of Yang energy. Get energized and **core-toned** for steamy summer nights! Let's detox first and
then get all the sweet sukha (this is the good stuff) back into our lives. You'll love this! 

I promise. 

Each Class is 75' and starts with Pranayama or Breathing exercises. Followed by warming-up and then we start flowing. At the end there is always Savasana.
