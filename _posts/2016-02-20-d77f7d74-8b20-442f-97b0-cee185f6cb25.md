# Enjoy and discover Yoga with me
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0b0406de45f40c34aa4410e20ed6e985890b7ac0.jpg)

I teach to all levels.

**Beginners** can enjoy the beginnings of **Hatha Yoga and Vinyasa Flow.**

**Advanced students** can work with me on specific theme's or poses.

Remember: You don't have to be flexible to do yoga! You will become flexible by doing it.

I just want you to relax and enjoy what we do :-)

Please communicate openly with me. Tell me where you are in your yoga
journey, your goals, your expectations and your fears. From there we 
begin.

I also want to know how your health issues are, do you have pain 
somewhere in your body or not? This is really important because I want 
you to feel better in your body, so we have to know where we have to 
focus on.

And then... just let go and have fun with me on the mat.
