## Wendy Yogini 

I was born in La Paz, Bolivia but at the age of 9 my parents moved to Belgium.   
As a child I loved to dance. Movement on music was everything for me and from the age of six I learned every possible dance. I kept dancing like a maniac until I started my studies as a master in the Audio-Visual Arts in RITS. Soon after my graduation I started to work for Television.  Long hours and lot's of stress are very common in this kind of job but I love it; because I'm always working with different people, different places and I'm always telling story's. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d207a5d0ec1f2a60ea698f3347a9b96f251f4a5e.jpg)

Besides my work I've always been passionate about sports so I danced 
modern dance, almost every latin dance in competition and oriental 
dances. I have my Padi Certicicate as a Rescue Diver even though I've 
always been scared of water. So I had to overcome this fear first before
even starting to dive! I have to tell you when I set my mind on 
something there are few things that can stop me from achieving it. 

My love 
for yoga began in 2004\. I was privileged to start my lessons with Feroz 
Kahn in the first Bikram Yoga Studio in Belgium. I loved the practice in
the hot room and the routine was very handy to empty my mind from 
chatter. After some years loving that; my curious mind wanted to learn 
other sorts of Yoga and I started practicing Hatha Yoga, Hot Yoga, 
Kundalini. And one day I found myself in a Vinyasa Flow Class, the 
dancer in me woke up again and since then I'm all passionate about the 
Flow.

During the winter of 2014 I realized that my son Romeo (7 at that time) was quite stressed in school.  So drawn by the mental relief yoga gave me from my job, I decided to become a yoga teacher to teach my son and other kids how to stop the chatter of their minds with yoga.

My teacher training in Suryalila in the Frog Lotus International in Spain with Vydia Heysel was life changing for me. I realized I wanted to give this gift I've had for years in my hands to everyone. I still work for television but I've found a balance in my life to teach Hatha 
and Vinyasa Flow from the heart. 

I'm always finding ways to improve my lessons, always learning new styles and taking various courses or workshops in Belgium and abroad. That way I can give my students a whole inmersion in Yoga. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4365779d75063a7e2789c9b971ad9dd14d555fbb.jpg)

Yoga changed my life in ways I didn't thougth possible and I hope to give the light and peace it gives me to everyone
around me.

From my heart to all of you, Namasté
