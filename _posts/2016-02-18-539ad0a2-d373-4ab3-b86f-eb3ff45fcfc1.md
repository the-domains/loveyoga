I was born in Bolivia but at the age of 9 my parents moved to Belgium.    
As a child I loved to dance. Movement on music was everything for me and from the age of six I learned every possible dance. This stayed until I discoverd yoga in my twenties. My curiousity about life made me a reader of anything and everything. I'm always eager to find out the truth about things, the drive of people, the way life goes, the why things happen, the way our body works... 

My imaginations is very vivid and I've always liked to capture moments in a "box". Let this be by painting, drawing, taking pictures, poems or filming. 

Drawn to the magic of storytelling and images I got my master degree as a Director in Audio-Visual Arts in RITS and soon after my graduation I started to work for Television  Long hours and lot's of stress where very common on my job but I loved it because I was always working with different people, different places and always telling story's. 

My love 
for yoga started in 2004\. I was privileged to start my lessons with Feroz Kahn in the first Bikram Yoga Studio in Belgium. I loved the practice in the hot room and the routine was very handy to empty my mind from chatter. After some years loving that my curious mind wanted to learn other sorts of Yoga and I started practicing Hatha Yoga, Hot Yoga, Kundalini. And one day I came across in a Vinyasa Flow Class, the dancer in me woke up again and since then I'm all passionate about the Flow.

In 2014 I did my Yoga teacher training in Frog Lotus International 
School in Spain and I'm teaching private lessons since. I teach Hatha 
and Vinyasa Flow. And am always finding ways to improve my lessons, always learning new styles and taking various courses or workshops in Belgium or abroad. That way I can give my students a whole inmersion in Yoga. 

I love yoga because it brings peace in my head, in my heart, my body 
and soul. And I hope to give the light and peace it gives me to everyone
around me.

From my heart to yours, Namast√©.
