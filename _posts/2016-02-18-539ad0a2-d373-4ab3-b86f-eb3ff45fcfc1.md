I was born in Bolivia but at the age of 9 my parents moved to Belgium.  As a child I loved to dance. Movement was everything for me. Drawn to the magic of storytelling I did my master in Cinematography in RITS and soon after my graduation I started to work as a Television Director. Long hours and lot's of stress where very common on my job but I loved it because I was always working with different people, different places and alwasy telling story's. My love 
for yoga started in 2004\. I first started with Bikram Yoga because I 
loved the challenge in the hot studio.And the routine was very handy to empty my head. After some years loving that I 
wanted to become more peacefull and started practicing Hatha Yoga. But 
for me that wasn't challenging enough so there came the dancer in me again and
I fell in love with Vinyasa Flow.

In 2014 I did my Yoga teacher training in Frog Lotus International 
School in Spain and I'm teaching private lessons since. I teach Hatha 
and Vinyasa Flow. And am always finding ways to improve my lessons, always learning new styles and taking various courses or workshops in Belgium or abroad. That way I can give my students a whole inmersion in Yoga. 

I love yoga because it brings peace in my head, in my heart, my body 
and soul. And I hope to give the light and peace it gives me to everyone
around me.

From my heart to yours, Namast√©.
