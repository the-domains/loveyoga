I was born in Bolivia but lived from my 9 years in Belgium. My love 
for yoga started in 2004\. I first started with Bikram Yoga because I 
loved the challenge in the hot studio. After some years loving that I 
wanted to become more peacefull and started practicing Hatha Yoga. But 
for me that wasn't challenging enough so there came the dancer in me and
I fell in love with Vinyasa Flow.

In 2014 I did my Yoga teacher training in Frog Lotus International 
School in Spain and I'm teaching private lessons since. I teach Hatha 
and Vinyasa Flow.

I love yoga because it brings peace in my head, in my heart, my body 
and soul. And I hope to give the light and peace it gives me to everyone
around me.
