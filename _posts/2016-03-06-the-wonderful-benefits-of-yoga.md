Heart Benefits: Yoga can help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar; all of this which are good for your heart and blood vessels.

Overall Fitness: Practicing yoga a couple times a week
increases muscle strength and flexibility, boosts endurance, and tunes up your
heart, lungs and blood vessels.

Weight Control: Mindfulness developed through yoga can make you more sensitive to cues of hunger and fullness, which help you develop a more positive relationship with food.

happiness for me' -- Wendy Yogini
