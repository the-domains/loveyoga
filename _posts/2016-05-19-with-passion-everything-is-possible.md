**What it means to live with passion**

My passionate heart has made me fall on my face everytime. And the same heart has made me get up stronger.

I was always a fragile girl, always easily hurt because I've always lived with an open heart. And for years I thought my open heart was my weakness but growing up I learned that all that vulnerability actually was my strength and learned this the hard way. How? By closing my heart and see what that does! It slowly kills you and your loved ones... It aliniate you from everyone, and the hardest part. It aliniates from yourself.
