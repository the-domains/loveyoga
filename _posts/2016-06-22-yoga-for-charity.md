## Yoga for Charity

Resently I joined this wonderfull group of yogi's in Brussels! It's the KARMA YOGA PROJECT BRUSSELS.

The Karma Yoga Project Brussels is a sister organisation to the original Karma Yoga Project in London. KYP Brussels aims to connect yogis in Brussels who want to work for a positive change in the world. 100% of proceeds from events go directly to organisations working to improve the lives of people around the world.   
Join the Karma Yoga Project Brussels and together we can work to spread love, compassion and change.
