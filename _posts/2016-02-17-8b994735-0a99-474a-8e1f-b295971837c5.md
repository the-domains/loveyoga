Yoga comes from the Sanskrit rooth 'joke' wich means 'union' or 'to join'.

It's an ancient art based on a harmonizing the unity of body, mind and spirit. The continued practice of yoga will lead you to a sense of peace and well-being, and also a feeling of being at one with your environment. It's also the union of the individual soul with the Universal Spirit.

Yoga is a philosophy, a science and a discipline. And it has many branches. It's not really a religion although it is developed alongside Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism and contains elements of this 3 major Indian Religions.

The phisical practice of Yoga is called Hatha Yoga. This are the asana's (or postures) learend by Patanjali.  
**Hatha** translates to the force; of Sun and Moon.   
Ha refering to the hot Sun energy en Tha to the cool moon energy . This two energies flow through our body in the form of breath.

I believe it's good to start with Hatha Yoga, wich contains the basic of yoga asana's combined with breathing exercices. That is why I teach this style.   
Next to that you can enjoy Restorative Yoga and Vinyasa Flow with me.

**Restorative Yoga** is a soft and gentle class ideal to end a hard working day. With holding fewer poses for a longer period of time.  
____

**Vinyasa Flow** is, as the word it says, a dynamic form of yoga. I try to flow the diferent yoga poses of my Hatha Yoga Class into sequences directed for diferent purposes. It's relaxing and energising at the same time.__
