on a harmonizing the unity of body, mind and spirit. 
The continued practice of yoga will lead you to a sense of peace and 
well-being, and also a feeling of being at one with your environment.

Yoga
is a philosophy, a science and a discipline. And it has many branches.

Buddhism and Jainism and contains elements of this 3 major Indian
